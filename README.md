# belly-button-challenge

This activity allowed me to create an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

I successfully deployed the app to Github Pages: https://allen048.github.io/belly-button-challenge/
